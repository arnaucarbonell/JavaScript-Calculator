# JavaScript Calculator Logic

This repository contains the logic for a basic calculator implemented in JavaScript. This project focuses on the core mathematical functionality of a calculator (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) without any graphical interface. It can be integrated into a frontend or used as a standalone calculation module.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handling of decimal numbers and basic error handling (e.g., division by zero)
- Extendable for additional functions (e.g., exponentiation, square roots, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (for running the calculator logic in a local environment)
- A **code editor** (e.g., Visual Studio Code) or a JavaScript environment

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/javascript-calculator-logic.git
cd javascript-calculator-logic

## Usage

Since this is a logic-only calculator, you can use the methods by importing or requiring the `calculator.js` file in your JavaScript project. Below is a quick example of how to use the calculator functions in a Node.js environment.

### Example

In `calculator.js`, you'll have functions like `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.

You can call these functions to perform calculations:

```javascript
// Import or require the calculator functions
const calculator = require('./calculator'); // for Node.js

// Sample usage
const result1 = calculator.add(5, 3); // 8
const result2 = calculator.subtract(10, 2); // 8
const result3 = calculator.multiply(4, 2); // 8
const result4 = calculator.divide(16, 2); // 8

console.log(result1, result2, result3, result4);

### Functions Overview

| Function   | Description                                | Example Usage                    |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `add`      | Adds two numbers                          | `add(5, 3) // returns 8`         |
| `subtract` | Subtracts the second number from the first | `subtract(10, 2) // returns 8`   |
| `multiply` | Multiplies two numbers                    | `multiply(4, 2) // returns 8`    |
| `divide`   | Divides the first number by the second    | `divide(16, 2) // returns 8`     |

> **Note**: The `divide` function includes error handling for division by zero, returning a specific message or `NaN` if zero is used as the divisor.

## Tests

The project includes basic unit tests for each calculator function. To run tests:

1. Install any necessary test dependencies (e.g., Jest, Mocha) if not already included.
2. Run the test script:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements include:

- Support for more advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation, square roots)
- Parsing of complex expressions (e.g., `3 + 5 * (2 - 4)`)
- Conversion to a library that could support more advanced calculator functionality

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance the calculator, feel free to fork the project and create a pull request. Please ensure that new functionality is tested and documented.
